Action Items:

1. We may need to reconsider which type(s) of architecture fits our design better, and it comes with reasons

2. We need working sessions during the break

3. Main focus on the class design

4. Every member in team still needs to push own work to git

Agenda Items:

1. The main stuff we must have for the DESIGN docs are descriptions of design and class diagram
	- descriptions including architectures and classes
	- need to explain what architecture(s) is used and how the chosen architecture(s) does the work
	- need to do comparisons to other architecture types and give clear reason to choose the certain one(s)
	- for classes, give detailed information describing classes, such as data types or structures of fields, conditions, inputs, and outputs of methods
	- similar to Java doc format

2. still need to care about the AI design (it appears in REQS)
	- provide an AI architecture
	- consider how it will work in the system

3. traceability matters in the documentations
	- everything in the previous doc mentioned must appear in the later docs and traceable
	- a proof of a good architecture
