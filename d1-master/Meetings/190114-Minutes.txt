- Agreed to continue using the same format for meeting agendas.

- Frameworks:
    - slack for team communication
    - Trello for task distribution
    - doodle for meeting time arrangement

- Requirements doc discussion:

    Technical details should not be included at all. The requirements document 
    is supposed to give a high-level description of the program, meaning what 
    a user can expect to see in the actual implementation. Overall description 
    of how the game functions at the top level. Can expect to have more 
    detailed guidelines for this document from the upcoming Friday's lecture.

- Repository file structure:

    Suggested structure:

        /doc
        -> /req doc
        -> /design doc
        ...

        /meetings
        --> /Meeting1 or /19XXXX
            --> 20XXXX-Agenda
            --> 19XXXX-Minutes
        --> /Meeting2 ...

- General discussion about the aspects of focus:

    Unanimously agreed to make AI one of the main focus areas of the project.
    Technical details to be discussed at a later date. As we don't have team 
    members knowledgable in animation and/or graphical interfaces, the 
    initial decision was to make our implementation in 2D. Additionally, as 
    making a text interface for the game would be relatively straightforward 
    and would also accelerate the initial testing and debugging, started 
    considering making a 1D interface first.

- Next Meeting:
    
    Decided to play a round or two of Hanabi to become more familiar with the 
    game. The meeting has already been scheduled to 2017/01/17 4pm in Spinks.
    After this, planning to have a further discussion on the requirements doc.
