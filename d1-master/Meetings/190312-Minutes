Action Item:

- finish unit test plan
- work on TEST_PLAN document

Agenda Items:

- decide a specific part of the coding for each member

- test plan doc
	- no specific format, customization is allowed
	- three main sections
	- for unit tests:
		- variable functions, involves more logic functions, no sense to test getters and setters
		- very basic functions
	- show that the test plan is effective by choosing only worthwhile parts
	- for view class test, it will be dealt in end-to-end or integration tests
	
- timeline for the last month is good, as below:
	- Write End-To-End Tests
        - Write Integration Tests
        - Write Unit Tests
        - Scaffolding (test integration)
        - Documentation
        - Implementation (test units)
        - Testing (end-to-end)

- parts to code later: Controller, models, view, AI
- Everyone has a responsibility for one part, not necessary to stick with only one of the members, pairs can change
