CMPT370, Group D1

Action Items:
	current maintainer to look into giving one of the team members maintainer 
	privileges on gitlab.
	
Agenda Items:
	- Design patterns and architecture to be discussed further during lectures
	to avoid premature decisions.  
	- Talked about refining the writing process by making use of the tools 
	provided by git. 
	- Important Notes: 
		1) Design depends on the requirements doc. In the process of
	constructing the design doc, we should constantly use requirements as a 
	reference or skeleton.
		2) Design doc is for developers! Given a complete design document,
	a developer that hasn't previously worked on should be able to construct
	it without major issues. 
	
	- Setting up git to automatically build a pdf out individual text documents
	that use Tex markup. Need maintainer permission to make a hook for 
	accomplishing this as well. 
	- Settled on starting with Tex from the beginning for the design phase.
