CMPT370, Group D1

Action Items:

1. We need to start working on seperate branches
2. Division of work was agreed on
3. Regular Friday meetings was agreed on
4. We need to make a Q&A section in the slack

Agenda Items:

1. Our actors model needs to be changed slightly, we originally considered
the player/game-creator as 1 actor who varied by only 1 action each (create
game and join game).  We should actually consider them to be two seperate
roles.

2. Various additional items have been tabled from the table of contents as
we have realised some of them are nessessary after the weekend of working on
them/considering them.  These sections are:
    3.7 will be stripped down to only 3.7.1
    3.4 will be kept as groundwork for the design phase, tabled for now
    2.5.2 will be tabled (tabled as it will be addressed by software/JVM)
    2.4.4 will be tabled (redundant with 3.4)
    2.4.1 will be tabled (too specific to business applications)
    
3. We agreed that the current system of individually working on the sections is
good, and merging them into a Google Doc for formatting is probably the best
course of action for the final product.
