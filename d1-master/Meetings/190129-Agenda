1. Amendments to Agenda

2. Action Items
	a) Agreement on requirements division
	b) Agreement on the time of working session (every friday)

3. Agenda Items
    a) Discuss problems of requirement documentation 
       (any problems need to share and talk we meet when we do our assignment)
       - A few of the actions we came up with for the player actor will not be
       applicable given what we now know about how the server will function
            - randomDiscard
            - votekick
            - ready
            - start
        - A new potential action is:
            - AFK (allow the AI to play for you)
        - We need a better model of the server from an actor/actions perspective
        as right now our current model is based entirely on assumptions.
        - Some of the other sections are probably not very applicable to our
        project and can be removed.  We've currently tabled both 2.1 and 3.6,
        I believe that now 3.7 may also be unneeded
    b) Discuss the formation of requirement documentation 
        (After we all finish our assignment, how we put them together)
