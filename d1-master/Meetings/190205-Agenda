1. Amendments to Agenda

2. Action Items
    - One of us should become a maintainer on the repo
		
3. Agenda Items
    - What should we consider going into the design phase?
    
    - We need to refine our Git usage and improve before the next phase:
        - Milestones might be a good idea
        - Use the merge request interface (get used to it now)
        - Better usage of tags
        - More effective usage of branches
        - Learn how to use git stash
        - Versioning on the design documents? (as practice for later)
        - Setup git for auto-building of a pdf via a makefile
        
    - We should start with TeX from the beginning for the design phase
        - We should all probably learn a little TeX, this will allow
        for more modular creation of the design documents
        
    - Some preliminary ideas for AI design have been flesh out
        - We probably want a logical layer ontop of the statistical layer
