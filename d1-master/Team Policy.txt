As students of University of Saskatchewan, all our group members are expected to be familiar with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect.

All group members should read and be familiar with the Regulations on Academic Student Misconduct, as well as the Standard of Student Conduct in Non-Academic Matters and Procedures for Resolution of Complaints and Appeals. This is especially important for this course, because teamwork requires regular and candid interaction, but it must be respectful and constructive.
