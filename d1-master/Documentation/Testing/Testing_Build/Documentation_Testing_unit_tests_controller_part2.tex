    			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item[SendMove] responsible for sending data to the server
	\begin{itemize}
		\item + server responsed: this method will be test together with receive server data, it will check if there is a reply message sent by server after sendMove method is called. Server has to reply something after it sends a JSON package
	\end{itemize}
	\item[PackStream] convert a move message from the player's action into a JSON object which can be read by server
	\begin{itemize}
		\item + Right move is constructed: check the information that output object contains, a JSON object should be created with correct action, correct player, and correct card based on the user's input
	\end{itemize}
	\item[handleInputEvent] listens to mouse events and does functions based on different requests
	\begin{itemize}
		\item several mock situation will be given to verify all five mouse events (mouseOver, mouseOut, mousePressed, mouseDraged, mouseReleased) are successfully handled
	\end{itemize}
