A network connection is essential for the program to interact with the system server. Computing device, the client using to run the program, should be able to support a network. Any networking issue causing an interrupt of the connection may terminate the game program.

A two-way network connection is required to allow clients to ask requests and receive messages from the server. The networking protocols used for communication between clients and the server of the system should guarantee data packets sent and received.

# this might not be necessary because developing processes are more related to designing stage, probably not fit to requirement docs.
