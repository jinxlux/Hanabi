3.3 Performance Requirements

3.3.1 Number of Users to be Supported

The client will support a direct connection between two users.  A server, and
an end user.  The server itself will be responsible for handling mutliple users,
but from the perspective of any individual client running on a machine, there
are only ever two users connected to it at any given time.

3.3.2 Information Handling

The client will be responsible for communicating with the server, and reciving
communications from the server.  The parsing of information from the server
format will need to be fast enough to create a smooth experience for the end
user.  Although "smooth experience" is hard to quantify, it should be still
be verifiable in the testing phase.

When the client is running the AI mode, it will need to be able to calculate
its best move and send a properly formatted packet in the given time-out 
timeframe.  This means that the basic functionality of the AI must be reasonably
efficent given its limited time resources.
