3.9 Reliability Requirements

A simple reliability index will be used to quantify the readiness of the system.
First, a set of quantifible metrics will be used to guide the process of 
reliability engineering: failure rate, known remaining bugs, and testing 
coverage.  Secondly, the individual issues which these categories address
will be weighted based on the severity of the bug, ranging from serious (the
bug causes an unexpected fatal error) to trivial (the bug causes an small
graphical error for a moment).

This scheme aims to guide the design and testing of a reliable system. Giving
a valuable metric to measure progress and quality with.  However, like the
maintainability index, the goal is not to maximize this value, but to
use it as an aid to help guide the engineering process.
