3.8 Maintainability Requirements

A maintainability index will be calculated using both lines-of-code and
number-of-modules as a pair of quantifible metrics which will attempt to predict
the amount of effort that will be required to maintain the program. The goal 
will not be to explicitly use this index as a measure of success, but as a rough
heuristic to help guide development.

The application of this metric should help to maximize the useful life, 
efficiency, and safety of the software, while leaving some space for future 
improvements. Keeping the project simple should facilitate easier bug fixes
in shorter amounts of time.
