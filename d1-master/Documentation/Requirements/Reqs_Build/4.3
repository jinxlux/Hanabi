4.3 Performance Requirements

4.3.1 Number of Users to be Supported

4.3.2 Information Handling

To verify the performance aspect of the networking function, a series of tests
that aim to quantify the network latency will be performed.  The goal will be
to get the client behaving in a way that most users would agree is "smooth".
Although this is hard to quantify directly, a series of user-experience based
questions should give adequate information on if we're heading in the correct
direction. Some examples of questions that could aid in quantifying the
performance of the game are:
    - Did the game feel more or less responsive?
    - Were you frustrated with the loading times?
    - Where can the experience made to be more enjoyable (from the perspective
    of performance)
    - Did you notice any considerable slowdown at any point?

After every build that addresses the issues of performance, the team will 
discuss how the new build felt, and if the alterations to the client side
performance were an enhancement, or a deteriment to the enjoyability of using
the application.

Another tool that could be looked at to help determine if performance 
requirements have been met are examining the FPS, examining the network
response time, and exaimining the profile of the software while running, but
these are only tools to help guide the process, as verification will be
considered complete when a unianimous decision is reached within the team.


When running in AI mode, it will suffice to generate tests that will quantify
response time, and use this as a metric to verify that the AI can, within some
level of certainty, respond to the server with a valid move in a given period
of time.
