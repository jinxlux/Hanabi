2.2 Product Functions

Through both the CLI and GUI, the user will be able to play the card game 
Hanabi. The game involves 3 basic actions those being:
    - play a card,
    - discard a card, and
    - give a hint.
    
The program allows a user to do one of the following 3 actions pre-game:
    - create a table by specifying the game options,
    - join a table through a game-id,
    - make an AI player join the game through a game-id.

The game is terminated when all of the in-game fuses run out, there are no more
cards to draw (each player allowed one more turn after this happens) or one or 
more of the players disconnect from the server.

2.2.1 Actors and Use Cases
There are 3 actors in this program:
    - a game master, 
    - a regular player, and
    - an AI bot.

A game master (GM) is the creator of the table and is responsible for specifying 
the number of players (including themselves) that will be playing. The action of 
joinin a table is not possible for a GM, because as soon as they request the 
creation of a new table they automatically join this new table. Other than the
pre-game setup a GM's capabilites and possible actions are identical to that
of a regular player. Possible actions for a GM are:
    - Create table
    - Play a card
    - Give a hint
    - Discard a card
    - View discarded cards
    - Create personal notes for each card
    - Start the AI (AFK)
    - Stop the AI (BOK)
    - Exit table

A regular player's available pre-game action is joining a game, which includes
connecting to an already created server through a game-id. A regular player can:
    - Join table (player)
    - Play a card
    - Give a hint
    - Discard a card
    - View discarded cards
    - Create personal notes for each card
    - Start the AI (AFK)
    - Stop the AI (BOK)
    - Exit table
    
An AI bot is invoked by a human and given unique identyfying information along
with a game-id, which enable it to join the desired server. Upon joining, the
BOT is expected to play until the game is terminated. An AI Bot can:
    - Join table (AI)
    - Play a card
    - Give a hint
    - Discard a card
    - View discarded cards

List of actions: 
- Create table
    This action is only available for the game master. The GM is supposed to 
    give some options like the number of players and the time limit for making
    a move as option for the new server. 

- Join table (player/AI)
    (player) A player can join a server by specifying the game-id. After this 
    they are able to do all of the list in-game actions.
    
    (AI) Techincally, a human invokes the AI with a game-id and identifying 
    token to join a server.
    
- Play a card
    Due to the nature of Hanabi, a player is completely unaware (at least at the
    very beginning) of their own hand. A typical game would involve playing a 
    card only after recieving a relevant hint. Upon selecting a card to play, 
    the card is then "placed on the table face-up" and if it was a valid move,
    meaning it was a continuation of an existant pile or a start of a new one,
    the card is placed on top of the relevant pile. If the move was invalid, 
    the card is moved to the discard pile and the number of fuses decreases by
    one. After this action is completed, other players at the table will be 
    able to see the updated state of the table (each pile's top card, number of
    fuses, discard pile are the 3 things that subject to change).
    
- Give a hint
    The precondition for this action is there being at least one available 
    information token. After selecting which player should be given a hint,
    along with the properties of the card(s) to give information about, the 
    entire table is informed of the given information. The hint may be about 
    either the color or the number of the card(s), but not both. 
    
- Discard a card
    Upon selecting the discard a card action and which card should be discarded, 
    only if the number of available information tokens is less than 8, the 
    selected card is added to the discarded cards, 1 information token is 
    restored, and a new card is drawn from the cards pile.  
    
- View discarded cards
    At any point during the game, it is possible to view all the cards until 
    that point in the game that were discarded. 

- Create personal notes for each card
    Along with recieving regular hints from a plyer during a game of Hanabi 
    there is the possibility of recieving pseudo-hints about one's cards.
    These pieces of information can be hard to keep mental track of which is
    why each player has the ability to mark any card in their with a guessed
    color or number.

- Start the AI (AFK)
    At any point during the game a player can activate the AFK (Away From 
    Keyboard) option, which invokes an AI bot that plays for the player while
    they are gone. 

- Stop the AI (BOK)
    Upon deactivating the option, the control of one's hand is returned to 
    them indicating that they are Back On Keyboard (BOK).

- Exit table
    Both regular players and the game master are allowed to exit the server
    at any point during the game. After selecting this action the connection
    to the server is severed and the interfaces closes.
