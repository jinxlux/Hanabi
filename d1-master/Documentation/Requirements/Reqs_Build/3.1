3.1 External Interface

3.1.1 User Interface
After launching the application, the user will be presented with a title screen 
(Figure 1). The options given on this screen will allow users to create a new 
game table, join an existing game, start a basic tutorial, change 
some basic game settings, and lastly, exit the game.

a) Title Screen Interface:

If the user chooses to create a new game table, a dialog box for creating games
will be displayed (Figure 2). Users need to enter name of the game table and 
the maximum number of players that will be allowed in this game. ?? Moreover, it
also gives users an option whether the game will contains rainbow cards ?? At 
last, a create game button and a cancel button will be provided.

Next, if the player selects the 'join an existing game' option they will again
be shown a dialog box.  This dialog box will prompt the user for the name (or
address of the game they wish to join), and will provide the user a cancel
button that closes the dialog box.

If the user selects 'options', then the game will display a series of local
options that can be modified by the player.  This will allow them to slightly
customize their client.

If the user selects 'tutorial', the game will show a short animation of a few
rounds of play, explaining the basic rules of the game.

Lastly, if the user selects 'exit game', the client will close gracefully.

b) Game Table Interface:

After successfully creating a game or joining an existing game, the basic game
interface will be displayed (fig 3). The table will be separated into two
main parts. The left part of the screen will be the main game table, it is the
primary area of play (akin to a real table). Each (other) player will have an 
area on the screen where they're identified, and where the player (client) will
be able to see their cards. 

Cards in the player's (client) hand will be placed directly at the bottom of the
screen . At top right corner of each card, there will be 
two small tag areas (fig 4) which allow player to mark some simple deductions
on the back of the card. In the middle area, all cards that have been successfully 
played will be put in order and distinguished by colour. 

The right side of the screen will be utilized as a 'game status' area.
From top to bottom, all discards can be selected to view, 
time remaining will indicate time left in current turn, the number of cards left 
also be shown, and there will have the number of hint token and fuses token 
left on the table.

Additionally, this application will support command line interface, which would 
accept users input and display information through terminal.

** I don't believe we need to put the CLI in the req. docs at this point. For the
most part the CLI will just be a tool we use to help us debug the core
implementation of the client, and allow us to start working on other aspects
of the software before the GUI is finished **

3.1.2 Hardware Interface
Since the application does not have any application specific hardware, this
section will be brief. The basic hardware requirements are addressed by a keyboard
and mouse.  The network interfacing can be done by any standard, modern, network
interface card.

3.1.3 Communication Interface
Communication between different interfaces would be handled by the underlying 
operating system, and the communication between clients and server would use 
common network protocol such as TCP/IP.
